How Am I Doing ReadMe v1.0

Vision:
Young People and their families using Mental Health Services should be in control, in particular, of the data they provide.  It should be available to them to understand their own progress, using the tools to which they have access: mobile phones, tablets, PC’s etc..  Sharing their data with services should be under their control. Data needs to be available in a format that respects their preference and be age-appropriate.

What is the need?
•	Problems for young people and families
o	Have no control over own data
o	Cannot readily access information tracking progress
o	No feedback loop to be able to use data meaningfully and communicate with therapist  - disempowering
o	Difficult to review things outside of sessions
•	Problems for clinicians
o	No access to real time information about outcomes to support their work with cyp
o	Time spent in sessions inputting and/or analysing data to make it useful
o	Doing pointless tasks (data collection with no feedback) damages therapeutic engagement
•	Problems for services
o	Wasteful of resources

How this project will improve things ?
•	Benefits for Users
o	Clear intelligible feedback
o	Access to control of  and personal data
o	Share clear information instantly with clinicians
o
•	Benefits for Clinicians
o	Notice change or its absence
•	Benefits for Services
o	Improved Data Quantity and Quality
What this App does?
•	Collects RCADS outcome data for mood and  displays time – series of collected data in accessible and engaging way for young people.
•	Permits the sharing of that information with clnicians and others.

What we would like this App will do in the future?
•	Link into self help tools

Young People’s Decision Making Capacity and Data Management.
•	How can parents, clinicians and young people negotiate who should be in charge of this data given legislation on parental responsibility and Fraser guidelines on decision capacity of young people?
•	How should risk be communicated, if detected in the use of this app.  To whom should it be communicated: YP, parent clinician?
